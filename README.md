# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Task Management Application
## Objective

This project is a React-based Task Management Application designed to help users create, manage, and track tasks efficiently. The application includes features like task creation, editing, deletion, subtasks, and task filtering to streamline task management.

## Features
-> Task Creation:
Users can create tasks with a title, description, and due date.

-> Task List:
Display a list of all tasks with their status (pending/completed).

-> Task Editing:
Users can edit the task's title and description.

-> Task Deletion:
Allows users to delete tasks they no longer need.

-> Subtasks:
Users can add and manage subtasks for each task.

-> Completion Status:
Tasks and subtasks can be marked as completed.

-> Task Timestamps:
Display task creation and deletion dates.

-> Task Filtering:
Filter tasks by their status (pending/completed).

->  User Authentication (Optional):
The project has provisions for adding user authentication in the future.

## Technologies Used
-> React: Functional components for building the UI.
-> React Hooks: Used for state management and side effects.
-> React Hook Form: For managing forms and validation.
-> React Router: Enables smooth navigation between pages.
-> Tailwind CSS: Used for styling the UI.
-> Local Storage: Data persistence for tasks using the browser's local storage.
-> Firebase Hosting: For deploying the app.
